### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because it was a way to tell the number of days in between 2 dates we could input. We were able to use math and it was interesting to find each input. It also helped me learn a lot more then I did.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was very cool toode with my partner. It was a it more difficult but I enjoyed making a cool moving image. It did take a bit more work especially making all the for loops in the beginning and calling the function.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was where I was able to lean how t lint and all the basic stuff we needed to know. I learned how to print something out which is the easiest thing to do. I was able to print out Hello world, although it was a simple lab it helped me learn a lot.
